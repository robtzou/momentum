 STUDENT WELLNESS & HABITS PROFILE
======================================================================
This report summarizes the student's self-reported daily habits,
commitments, and preferences to inform support strategies.

--- 1. Logistics & Commitments ---
* Living Situation: On-Campus Resident
* Home Base / Parking: South campus

* Fixed Commitments:
  - classes (ESJ) on MWF from 2:00pm to 6:00pm
  - classes (Hornebake) on TTh from 3:00pm to 6:00pm
  - work (Online) on Friday from 10:00am to 1:00pm

  > Advisor Note: Review the density of this schedule.
    Check for 'buffer time' between classes and locations.

--- 2. Daily Rhythm & Energy ---
* Ideal Sleep Schedule: Wake up at 8:00am and go to sleep at 12:00pm
* Preferred 'Workday': 11:00am to 10:00pm
* Peak Focus Time: Afternoon

  > Advisor Note: Compare ideal sleep with actual commitments.
    A 'Afternoon' preference may conflict with
    an early class schedule, creating a friction point.

--- 3. Study & Work Preferences ---
* Preferred Study Style: Standard Sessions (e.g., 50 min work, 10 min break)
* Task Management: Warm-Up (Schedule 1-2 easy tasks first)
* Weekly Study Goal: 12 hours
* Favorite Study Spots: ESJ Basement, Hornebake Basement, 7th Floor McKeldin

  > Advisor Note: The goal of 12 hours/week
    is a key self-reported pressure point. The student's task
    approach ('Warm-Up (Schedule 1-2 easy tasks first)') is a good indicator
    of their coping mechanism for difficult work.

--- 4. Personal Habits & Well-being ---
* Meal Habits: I go to the dining hall
* Exercise Frequency: 3
* Exercise Duration: 60
* Scheduled Downtime: Yes

  > Advisor Note: The student's meal, exercise, and downtime
    habits are foundational to well-being. Their stated
    downtime preference is a good starting point for
    building a sustainable work-life balance.
